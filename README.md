@P-Darabi 's note on Kaggle, I learn from this amazing note using CNN in brain tumor detction, original link:https://github.com/P-Darabi/Brain-Tumor-Detection

This study aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the PyTorch framework that can accurately detect and classify Brain Tumors from MRI scans. The CNN will be trained on a large dataset of labeled brain tumor images to learn the patterns and features associated with different tumor types. The study aims to achieve high accuracy in tumor detection and classification, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in the field of neuro-oncology. The ultimate goal is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor diagnosis, enabling timely and appropriate treatment planning for patients.
